                                of payments into the borrowal account; The Principle of FIFO i.e., ' First In First Out accounting
                                method is relevant to arrive at the No of days of overdue for determining the SMA/NPA status.
                                The FIFO principle assumes that the oldest outstanding dues in the loan account needs to be cleared
                                first. The FIFO method thus requires that what is due first must be paid by the borrower first. <br />
                                For example: If in any loan account as on 01.02.2021 there are no overdues and an amount of Rs. X
                                is due for payment towards principal instalment/interest/charges any payment being credited on or
                                after 01.02.2021 in the loan account will be used to payoff the dues outstanding on 01.02.2021.
                                Assuming that nothing is paid/or there is partial payment (Rs Y) of dues during the month of
                                February, the overdue as on 01.03.2021 will be Rs. X-Y. <br />
                                Additionally, an amount of Rs Z becomes due as on 01.03.2021. Now any payment partial
                                payment into the account on or after 01.03.2021 will be first utilized to payoff the partial due
                                of 01.02,2021(Rs X- Rs Y). If there is more recovery that the Rs. X- Rs.Y then after recovering
                                dues of 01.02.201, the remaining amount will be treated as recovery towards due of 01.03.2021.
