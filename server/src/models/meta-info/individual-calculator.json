FDs are the gold standard for the Indian investor looking for safety of investment and predictability of returns. The concept is simple. You promise to keep a certain amount of money with the bank or any other deposit-taking financial institution for a fixed amount of time. In return, the bank gives you a fixed rate of interest on that amount. Now, FDs come in all shapes and sizes. You can invest crores or as little as ₹1000, depending on the bank. The period of an FD can range from anywhere between 7 days to 10 years. The interest can get compounded monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually. You can also choose to get the interest paid out to you at these frequencies rather than have it go back into the FD.  There are various penalties and charges for early withdrawal and some FDs are more flexible than others on such charges. But whatever type of FD you choose, they all have one thing in common. You will get back the money you’ve put in along with interest. The Fi Money fixed deposit calculator is an online tool that will show you the amount you can expect from an FD of your choice upon maturity."

The lower rate of interest can result in negative real returns when inflation is running higher than FD rates. This means you can end up losing the value of your money instead of it appreciating over time.<br /><br /> Long-term FDs are also a losing bet when interest rates are rising since they can lock you in at a lower rate compared to the prevalent market conditions. But when it comes to safety, there’s nothing like an FD to balance a high-risk portfolio. Or you just know that you’re going to need a certain amount available to you after a couple of years like higher education, a trip abroad, marriage even.<br /><br /> FDs come in handy to ensure that you’ll have that money at maturity. But calculating the interest you will earn and the total amount you will receive at maturity can be a tedious task. Or you may want to compare your FD returns with other investment options to aid you in making an important decision.<br /><br /> This is where an FD interest calculator can help.

Most FDs are simple enough when it comes to the variables involved but calculating the returns can get a bit tedious. To take care of all the hassles of calculation, here are a few details you need to fill in to allow this FD interest calculator to help you.</div><br /><ul><li>How much do you want to put into an FD? - This is what's called the principal amount upon which the interest rate will be calculated. You can invest anything from as little as  ₹1000 to crores in FDs, depending on the bank or financial institution.</li><br /><li>What is the interest rate this FD will give you? - Different types of FDs will give different rates of interest depending on a number of factors, one of which is the time period. The longer the FD period, the higher the interest and vice versa. FD rates are decided by banks and can vary from bank to bank for the same FD period.</li><br /><li>How long are you willing to not touch this money? - Many people see FD as a form of forced savings since you cannot use the money until maturity. Maybe you know exactly when you’ll need the money in the future or maybe these are just funds you need to set aside for safety. But if you do find yourself in a situation where you have to ‘break’ the FD, it usually involves penalties and charges. Not to mention you lose out of the compounding effect of the interest.</li><br /><li>What’s the compounding frequency of this FD? - This is the frequency with which the interest generated on your FD gets accrued into the principal amount. This is the process of compounding which ensures you get a higher interest amount in successive compounding cycles since your principal amount keeps on increasing. The frequency can be monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually.</li></ul>"

Even though you can get twice the returns or more through equity mutual funds and other investment options, Indians just can’t do without the safety and predictability of returns that FDs provide.<br /><br /> Besides, some FDs can save you tax as well. The amount you put in an FD is exempt from income tax as long as you maintain the FD for 5 years. However, the interest gained on this FD is taxable. FDs are a great option if you can plan your investments based on certain large expenditures in the future for which you will need the money to be completely safe.<br /><br /> These can be anything from education to purchasing a high-end gadget. And this is exactly the benefit the Fi Money fixed deposit calculator provides. It gives you visibility on the returns you can expect on your FDs minus the tedious calculations. It allows you to plan your investment or simply compare returns with other investment options."

Renting is a relatively less intimidating decision since you can always pack up and move out. But one thing that is common to both is location, location, and location. This has implications on many other factors like the price tag the house comes with or the rent. If you want to buy a house, this will also affect the loan you may need to take to finance the decision and the repayment terms.

None of these additional costs should matter to you if you’ve decided to go with renting out a place.</div><br /><div><b>Decision making:</b></div><div>Another factor that is highly dependent on location is how much the value of the property will appreciate over the years. Since buying a house involves a sizeable amount of investment over renting, in the short term at least, it's important to consider how the property value appreciates compared with had you decided to invest the money in other financial instruments. The amount of time you plan on staying in the house will play a big role when it comes to renting. It is assumed you will stay or hold the property for the long term if you buy a house. But if you’re paying rent, there will come a point in time when you end up paying more than the cost of the house if you stay long enough.

Luckily, the Fi Money rent vs buy calculator is here to help with one of those things. Here’s a couple of things you’ll need to put down so that this online calculator can do its work.</div><br /><ul><li>Which city do you live in? - This will help us look up the real estate price projections in your city of choice. The projected value of houses is based on <a style='color: #00B899' href='https://residex.nhbonline.org.in/' target='_blank'>the RBI survey</a> conducted across Indian cities.</li><br /><li>What is the probable rent of the house you want to own? - You can look up property sites or apps to figure this out. It will be used to make a comparison against the cost of buying the house.</li><br /><li>By how much will your rent go up annually? - Just like prices, rent goes up too. Rent is usually hiked by 5% on an annual basis.</li><br /><li>What is the cost of the house you want? - You can check property listings online to fill out this one. And there’s no need to panic at the number of zeroes.</li><br /><li>What is the down payment you can afford? - This is important since it will determine terms of a potential home loan and consequently how buying that house compares to renting. Banks typically ask for 10% of the loan amount as a down payment.</li><br /><li>Housing loan interest rate - This will depend on a number of factors from your credit score to market conditions, but in general, it is lower than other types of loans. Banks decide the interest rate on loans but you can put in your best guess.</li><br /><li>What’s your loan tenure? - Home loans comparatively have a longer tenure to ease the repayment burden. This will decide your EMI amount. Higher the tenure, lower the EMIs and vice versa.</li><br /><li>How do you normally invest? - Are you all about that high-risk-high-return game? Do you like to balance the risk across your investment portfolio? Or do you prefer to keep your money safe? Why are we asking this? If you invest in buying a house, the difference between your home loan EMIs versus your monthly rent could have been invested in other financial instruments. This is the opportunity cost of buying a house which is another factor this online calculator uses to make as accurate a comparison as possible.</li><br /><li>What is your optimism level about housing prices? - One factor in your decision to buy a house could be that you're optimistic of the prices going up in the future. An indication of your optimism levels will be compared against what we know of property price projections in your city.</li></ul><br /><div>The Fi Money rent vs buy calculator will take away the tediousness of comparing all these factors against one another and give you an idea of when it is better to rent and when it is better to buy that house.</div>"

It builds a healthy habit of saving and brings discipline to your investments. If you’re here, then it's likely that you’ve already ticked one decision off the list and are going with SIPs. The next thing you’re probably thinking about is how much you should be investing with each SIP. And that’s exactly what an SIP goal calculator is all about. Like all things in finance, there are many ways to approach this decision.<br /><br />One approach is to go bottom-up by considering an SIP figure and visualising the amount you’ll end up with after a certain amount of time. Another is a top-down approach where you consider the total amount you want after a period of time and break that down into a manageable fixed SIP amount. The Fi.Money SIP goal calculator is an online tool that takes the latter approach to simplify SIP investing, one step at a time.</div>"

Ultimately everyone invests to build wealth but it's important to know what you are building that wealth for.  Education? Vacation? A house? Retirement fund? All of the above?</li><br /><li>How long will you be investing? - Apart from your investment goal and its purpose, you should consider at what stage you are in life while answering this question. It's usually a good idea to take a long-term horizon to take advantage of the benefits of compounding and tax breaks.</li><br /><li>What’s your investment frequency? - One of the best aspects of investing through SIPs is that you can choose a frequency you’re comfortable with.

You also have the added flexibility to increase your SIP installments over time, an option which doesn’t exist for lump sum investing. Additionally, your returns also depend on the time of your exit when you withdraw the funds. Ultimately, your returns will depend on a combination of all these factors and there’s nothing to say that one will give more returns than the other. Choosing between the two all depends on the financial condition you find yourself in and your goals.</div>"

                        "text": "<div>The PPF or Public Provident Fund is a government-backed investment option that has a lot going for it. The government backing is the first major advantage since not only is the amount you put in completely safe, the returns are guaranteed. The interest rate is decided by the government on a quarterly basis, which means it is not subject to market fluctuations.<br /><br /> The rate of interest is also typically in the 7-8% range, putting it ahead of fixed deposits and short-duration debt mutual funds. All this makes the PPF a great risk-free option if you’re looking for a safe bet, which is why it's been one of the most popular investment instruments for Indians over the 50 years of its existence. And we haven’t even got to taxation yet.<br /><br /> The PPF falls under the ‘EEE’ category of tax exemptions, which is the gold standard for a tax-efficient investment option. It stands for Exempt-Exempt-Exempt which means the money you put in is exempted from tax, the interest you earn while staying invested is exempted from tax and the amount you withdraw at the end of your investment duration is also tax-exempt. If you’re reading about PPF for the first time, you’re probably wondering why no one told you about this scheme sooner. But wait, there’s more.<br /><br /> You can start investing in PPF with as little as ₹500 a year and you can even take a loan against your PPF balance. So what’s not to like? Well for one, the PPF comes with a minimum 15-year lock-in period and only partial withdrawals are permitted after 5 years. A lot of things can happen in 15 years for which you may need the money. Also, this investment option comes with an upper limit of ₹1.5 lakh per year.<br /><br /> Now, with all these pros and cons, you probably want to know what your returns will look like over the years if you put your money into the PPF and that's exactly what the Fi Money PPF calculator is all about.</div>"

This can range from ₹500 to ₹1.5 lakh per year. The next thing is the duration of your investment. The minimum duration for this option is 15 years which can be extended by 5 years at a time. If you’ve already put in money into the PPF, then you’ll have to consider how much time you have left from when you opened the account till 15 years or till when you want to hold on to it.<br /><br /> The next thing you need is the applicable rate of interest.

All you need is to answer a few questions to see what you can get out of investing in PPF.</div><br /><ul><li>What is your monthly investment amount? - The PPF is one of the few investment options that have both a lower and an upper annual limit on investments along with a cap on the number of investments per year. Within a year, you can invest anywhere between ₹500 to ₹1.5 lakh. This can be done in a maximum of 12 instalments per year. That means if you plan to invest each month, you can invest a maximum of ₹12,500 per month.</li><br /><li>What’s your investment duration? - Here too, the PPF differs from other investment options with its looooong lock-in period of 15 years. That means you can only withdraw all your funds from the PPF after 15 years of opening an account. Thereafter, you can extend the duration of your PPF investments in blocks of 5 years, i.e. 20, 25, 30 and so on.</li><br /><li>What’s your current PPF balance? - If you’ve already invested in PPF then you don’t need to hear the pros and cons from us. Just enter your existing balance to help the calculator work out your returns.</li><br /><li>Rate of interest - Notice the lack of a question mark here. That’s because the government decides the rate of interest your PPF investments will get on a quarterly basis. This usually ranges between 7-8% and gets compounded annually. This calculator reflects the current PPF interest rate.</li><br /></ul><div>Taking all of this into account, the Fi Money PPF calculator will tell you the total amount you’ve invested, the interest you’ve gained and the total amount available to you at the end of your investment duration.</div>"

The long list of pros makes it quite an effective investment avenue for the risk-averse investor or for the safe part of your portfolio.<br /><br /> Guaranteed, government-backed, non-stock market dependent, largely inflation-beating and higher-than-FD returns are just some of the reasons behind India’s affinity for the PPF. Not to mention the triple tax advantage it comes with.<br /><br /> Your investment amount, the interest on investment and the total amount at maturity are tax-exempt. But before you open your PPF account, which can be done in a matter of minutes at any bank or post office, here’s the catch. All the money you put into it isn’t going anywhere for the next 15 years from when you open an account, i.e. a lifetime of a lock-in period. Besides, there’s a cap on how much you can invest in the PPF, set at ₹1.5 lakh per year, and the number of instalments per year at 12.<br /><br /> Now, weighing all of this against each other and other investment options can be a difficult task. One way to go about it is to let the numbers speak for themselves.

The total amount repayable is split into equated monthly instalments (EMIs) to be paid over a fixed period of time.<br /><br /> When these details are fixed, the lender will provide you with an amortisation schedule. If you didn’t get that, there’s no reason to panic. Amortisation is a financial term that simply refers to the process of repaying a debt. The schedule will show you all your EMIs through the entire loan term and indicate how much of the loan has been paid off and how much is left with each EMI. It will also show you what part of the total amount you are paying off - interest and borrowed amount.<br /><br /> Typically, you start off by paying more of the interest amount and move on to clear the borrowed amount by the end of the loan duration. It is important to make sure you have the capacity to pay your EMIs regularly. If you happen to miss an EMI, it gets reported to credit bureaus that maintain your credit score, which will have a negative impact on your credit score.<br /><br /> One rule of thumb is to make sure your monthly EMIs do not go over 50% of your monthly income.

Not to mention, a great tax saving investment option as well. The NPS was established in 2004 and in many ways is an improvement over the other retirement fund options available.</div><br /><div>For one thing, it allows investors a degree of control over the way their money is invested. You can choose the level of risk you want to take on in terms of asset allocation between equity and debt investments. Or you can use the Auto choice option which lets the good folks at the NPS Trust decide for you. And the way they do that is based on your age. The idea is to allocate your investments based on your lifecycle. The younger you are the more risk-taking capacity you have and as you age, your investments are allocated more towards safer assets like government securities. And since the NPS is to a certain extent market-linked, returns can range anywhere between 5% to 20%.</div><br /><div>Besides these, there are a bunch of factors to consider if you’re thinking of opening an NPS account. For instance, it's a long term investment, and we mean looooooog term. Your money is essentially locked in until you turn 60. Although, tax-free withdrawals up to 25% of your total investment are allowed after a 3-year lock-in period. This is based on specific conditions like critical illness, skill development or a new business venture. And you won’t get your entire retirement corpus then since you have to invest at least 40% of the amount in an annuity. Annuity is the amount paid out to you every year, for the rest of your life after the NPS has matured.<br /><br />It ensures that while you get a lump sum amount, the rest will be given to you in monthly installments for the remainder of your retirement. This annuity investment again will give you returns depending on the prevailing interest rates in the future. And let’s not forget to account for inflation, which will have a profound impact on such a long term investment.</div><br /><div>The Fi Money NPS calculator is an online tool that can cut through all the clutter to give an idea of what you can expect when you exit the NPS all those years later.</div>"

The NPS is a great option, in case you’re thinking about it, and one with many factors to consider. And one way to understand how these factors might affect you and your money is to use the Fi Money NPS calculator.<br /><br />The first thing you should be thinking about is quite simply, your age. Once you start investing in the NPS, apart from some minor exceptions, you won’t be able to access that money until you turn 60, i.e, retirement.<br /><br />Next, you’ll want to think about how much you’re ready to set aside monthly for such a long term investment. The minimum investment is ₹500 per contribution along with a minimum annual investment of ₹1000.<br /><br />Another very important factor you should give some thought to is the kind of returns you’re expecting from the NPS. You can choose the degree of risk you’re willing to take or you can set your NPS account to Auto choice. This indicates the type of asset allocation your money will be invested in and consequently the kind of returns you can expect.<br /><br />Similarly, you will have to set your expectations of returns from your annuity investment. That’s because when you exit the NPS, you must invest a minimum of 40% of your total retirement corpus in annuities while you can keep the rest as a lump sum return.<br /><br />Based on these inputs, the Fi.Money NPS calculator can tell you the indicative profits you’ve gained, your total NPS contributions, the lump sum amount you can get along with the amount you would have to put into annuities. It will also tell you the monthly pension you could receive from the annuity investment and its present value adjusted for inflation. And finally, the yearly tax amount you may save.</div>"

For starters, it's one of the few investment options where you have to compulsorily invest a (substantial) part of your returns in another instrument at maturity. And don’t forget to account for the impact of inflation over the investment period. So, why not get rid of the maths and use the Fi Money NPS calculator online to get the job done? Here’s an example for more clarity.<br /><br />Meghna is a 25-year old analyst who’s thinking of opening an NPS account. She’s heard about the great tax savings and the long term benefits. But first, she needs to see some cold hard numbers to make an informed decision, as any of us would. So, naturally, she turns to the Fi Money NPS calculator.<br /><br />Now, here’s some things Meghna already knows. She’s ready to put down about ₹5000 every month in NPS. She’s done her research and expects an average of 12% returns from this investment. She knows that she’ll have to put at least 40% of her retirement corpus into annuities and expects a 6% return from there.<br /><br />And once she ran the numbers, she was quite impressed with the comprehensive results she got. This is what it looked like.<br /><br />At the age of 60, Meghna would have made a total investment of ₹15 lakh towards NPS. On this, she would earn profits of ₹3.1 crore. Her total retirement corpus would amount to ₹3.24 crore. The amount she can withdraw as lump sum upon exiting NPS would be ₹1.94 crore. And the remaining  ₹1.3 crore would have to go towards annuities. Her monthly pension from the annuity investment would be ₹64,953, but adjusting for inflation, that would amount to ₹8,451 in present day value. And she would have saved ₹19,800 annually in income tax.<br /><br />With this newfound clarity, Meghna decided that she would go ahead and open an NPS account and use this online NPS calculator to make adjustments in her investment strategy along the way.</div>"

To help salaried employees working in these private organisations get retirement benefits, the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) introduced the Employee Provident Fund scheme. Any organization or firm with 20 or more employees gets this benefit. Employees who fall under the EPF scheme, make a fixed contribution of their basic salary and dearness allowance. Simultaneously, the employer also makes an equal contribution to the scheme. At the time of retirement, the employee can take out a lump sum, which includes the contributions of both employee and employer with the interest payments.<br /><br />Employees under this scheme contribute 12%* of their basic salary and dearness allowance and the employer also contributes 12%*. After consulting with the Ministry of Finance, the EPFO Board of Trustees fixed the interest at 8.1% for FY2022*.<br /><br />In the case of employers, 12% is contributed which only a small part goes to the EPF account. Out of the 12%, 8.33% goes towards Employee Pension Scheme Account, and the balance of 3.67% is parked in the employee EPF account.</div>"
