                    We have an in-house network security team which uses
                    industry-leading products to conduct manual and
                    automated Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration
                    Testing activities

                    We employ both static application security testing and
                    dynamic application security testing. Both get
                    incorporated into our continuous integration /
                    continuous deployment pipeline

                    <br />
                    We will bring in auditors certified by Computer
                    Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) to do periodic
                    external testing and audits.
