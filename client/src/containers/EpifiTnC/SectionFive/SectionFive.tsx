                    An overview of what you should and shouldn&apos;t do while
                    using Epifi&apos;s Services. While we encourage you to read

                    points here. Essentially, you (the user) agree to comply
                    with all the regulations listed by the Company, Bank and
                    its third-party service providers. You also consent never to
                    do anything illegal, pay applicable taxes on time,
                    keep sensitive information (PIN, Passwords) from being
                    shared, and always prevent data breaches on the
                    Platform.
