                    <br />
                    The Company shall not be liable for any breach of these
                    T&Cs, due to any force-majeure event such as an act of
                    God, fire, lightning, explosion, flood, inclement
                    weather conditions, power failures, failure in any
                    communication systems, equipment breakdown, strikes,
                    lock-out or any other cause beyond the control of the
                    Company.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If any part of these T&Cs is determined to be invalid or
                    unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the
                    invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
                    superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most
                    closely matches the intent of the original provision and
                    the remainder of the T&Cs shall continue in effect.
