/**
 * @file Arrow Components
 *
 * This file exports custom arrow components used in carousels.
 * The LeftArrow and RightArrow components are created to accommodate different arrow styles in various carousels on our website.
 * By exporting them separately, we can easily choose the appropriate arrow component for a specific carousel or page.
 * If a different arrow style is needed, new variants of LeftArrow and RightArrow can be created and exported from here.
